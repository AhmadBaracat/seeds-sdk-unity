#Seeds Unity 5.x Package for Android

#Seeds
[Seeds](http://www.playseeds.com) increases paying user conversion for freemium mobile games motivating users to make their first purchase by letting them know that their purchase will help finance microloans in the developing world. The SDK implements this with an interstitial ad and event tracking analytics.

We also have available:

##The Seeds Unity SDK

The Seeds Unity Package is a wrapper for our Android SDK which is itself built with production-tested open source components including [Countly Android SDK](https://github.com/Countly/seeds-sdk-android).

##Overview
All you need to get started with integration is the special app_key “test”. This will show a test interstitial ad.

After testing, please make a deep link (see [how to make a deep link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-indexing/deep-linking.html)) to the in-app purchase item you’d like to promote (in-game virtual currency is a great choice).

If you haven't already, please also let us know your game name, in-app item and the deep-link URL to [sungwon@playseeds.com](sungwon@playseeds.com).

We will then set you up with an app_key specific to your game and make a custom ad for your game item.
